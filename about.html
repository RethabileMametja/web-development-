                        <h3>A Vision Takes Root</h3>
                        <p>In 2019, a small group of environmentally conscious neighbors in Melbourne's inner suburbs noticed something troubling. Despite living in one of the world's most livable cities, their community lacked green spaces where people could connect with nature and each other.</p>
                        <p>Sarah Chen, a local teacher and sustainability advocate, organized the first community meeting in her backyard. What started as a conversation between five neighbors about growing their own food quickly blossomed into something much bigger.</p>
                        <p>"We realized we all shared the same dream," recalls Sarah. "A place where children could learn where food comes from, where neighbors could share knowledge and resources, and where we could all contribute to a more sustainable future."</p>

                        <p>From 5 neighbors with a shared vision to 200+ members strong - our community has grown beyond our wildest dreams.</p>
